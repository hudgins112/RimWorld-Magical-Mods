	<description>If you are running Magical Growing, Magic Mending, and/or Magical Passive Cooling...UNSUB from those mods prior to running this mod. Those mods are my older versions and are not compatible with the updates in this new mod. Don't worry. All of the items in those mods are in this one...PLUS MORE!

Adds Alchemy and Black Magic to RimWorld! Intended to be used in Medieval/Neolithic builds.This mod is a WIP. A lot of updates and addons planned.</description>
